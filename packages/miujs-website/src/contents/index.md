# MiuJS overview
MiuJS is a minimal website development framework.

***

## Why MiuJS?

### Included all of the tools needed to build a small website
Building a website with MiuJS does not require any complicated environment construction. It has the following features:
- Dev server with browser live reload
- JavaScript bundler for browser ([esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/))
- Template engine ([Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/))
- Scoped CSS
- TypeScript support

### Designed for multiple Node.js platforms
Your website built with MiuJS can be hosted on the Node.js runtime as well as on the most popular platforms like Vercel and Netlify.

### CRUD action with minimal description
MiuJS has a file-system based router like Next.js. Writing a route file is very simple and is completed by exporting functions with HTTP method names such as get, post and put.

### Zero-dependencies for client bundle (v0.1.61)
Client-side JavaScript has no external dependencies. You can use your favorite libraries and frameworks like React, Svelte, jQuery, etc.
